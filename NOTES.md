NOTES:

- 'AssetConfigTxn' are NFT transactions -- you send one & you can create an NFT.
- That TXN type is able to carry a URL (so this could perhaps be part of the "NFT" -- maybe this links to public game profile?)

- Not sure exactly how to send _or_ view meta data in the algo explorer (that would be a good place to carry more info however, core stats for example)

- Is the total supply of each account itself? (e.g 1 account == 1 unit)
  - can't think of any reason not to? (yet)
